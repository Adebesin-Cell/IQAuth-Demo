## 🌟 Introduction

The **IQAuth Demo** is a demonstration of authentication features built using **wagmi** functions. It showcases functionalities like message signing, message verification, and typed data signing, making it easier to integrate web3-based authentication into your applications. This project is a work in progress, and contributions are highly encouraged to expand its capabilities!
